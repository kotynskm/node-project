# Project Overview

Tea Shop is a project I created to expand my knowledge of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and RESTful API development. It was created with MVC file structure. Tea routes are implemented to display info about teas in the database, or info about an individual tea by ID. User routes are implemented to display info, create, update, and delete users. Views are implemented using pug templating language.
